GamestreamLauncher is a simpler launcher application to help assist with operations to be completed before and after your gamestream session.

Operations on Session start:
Disable GPU Miner through Awesome Miner if running
Disable non-primary monitors if present
Run a custom script

Operations on Session end:
Run a custom script
Enable non-primary monitors that were previously disabled
Enable the GPU Miner through Awesome Miner if it was previously disabled
Close the Gamestream session


Installation:
Copy the release folder to your desired location.
Run GamestreamLauncher.exe to configure the launcher.
Add a custom game in Geforce Experience that points to the launcher.

The launcher is configured with the config utility when launching it for the first time.  You can run the config utility again by
deleting the user.config file that can be found at %localappdata%\GamestreamLauncher under the proper version.
